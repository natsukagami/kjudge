## Project Goals

- As lightweightedly deployable as possible (single binary, minimal dependencies)
- User friendly
- Doesn't get in the way (take minimal resources)

## Quick start

The fastest way to get kjudge up and runnning is through the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/natsukagami/kjudge).

It contains:

- kjudge itself
- Compilers for C++, Pascal, Java, Go, Rust, Python 2 and 3
- The [`isolate`](https://github.com/ioi/isolate) sandbox

Please checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/natsukagami/kjudge/wiki/Docker-Installation) for more information on how to get it up and running.

### Need more details?

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/natsukagami/kjudge/wiki)!

## Runtime dependencies

It should run on all platforms Go compiles to.

Required binaries:

- [`isolate`](https://github.com/ioi/isolate): The recommended sandbox.
  This is actually _optional_, however the only alternate sandbox implementation
  available (as of now) is the **raw** sandbox, which **DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY
  GUARDS AGAINST FOREIGN CODE** (which makes it okay to run when you are the
  only user).
  `isolate` is available on Linux systems only.

## Command line switches

```sh
> ./kjudge --help
Usage of ./kjudge:
  -file string
    	Path to the database file (default "kjudge.db")
  -sandbox string
    	The sandbox implementation to be used (isolate, raw). If anything other than 'raw' is given, isolate is used. (default "isolate")
```

## Build Instructions

External Dependencies:

```yaml
cc:      anything that compiles SQLite 3
go:      >= 1.13
node.js: >= 9
yarn:    >= 1
```

Go dependencies: See `tools.go`.
All Go dependencies can be installed with

```sh
scripts/install_tools.sh
```

### Production build

Build steps:

```sh
scripts/production_build.sh
```

### Development build

First, start the template generator and updater with

```bash
cd frontend
yarn && yarn dev
```

Note that it would block and watch for any updates on the front-end templates.

Now open a new terminal, run

```bash
go generate
```

to generate the models and load a development (live-reloading) version of the template packager.

Finally, run

```bash
go run cmd/kjudge/main.go
```

to run kjudge.
